NSCoders
========

NSCoders will act as a colaboration project between a group of people. The goal, besides creating an application, is to learn/enhance (at least) two things:

* iOS and objective-c
* Collaboration off-shore

The idea itself, in a nutshell, is to allow a person to search for a developer. Imagine the case where I, as a recruiter, need to find an iOS Developer. How can I do it? This application will try to satisfy this need.

How to contribute
============

Every contribution should be in the form of a **Pull Request**, without exceptions.  


Objective-C Style Guide
========

[The New York times's objective-c](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide) coding standards will be served as the guide for this application.


Continuous Integration
========

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to build the project. You can see the status here: [https://travis-ci.org/rbfigueira/nscoders](https://travis-ci.org/rbfigueira/nscoders)

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a hosted continuous integration service for the open source community. Travis CI will listen to push and pull request events to trigger new builds, member and public events to keep track of repository visibility and issue comment events.
